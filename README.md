# DSA & Projects Portfolio

## About Me
Hi! I'm Sandeep, an ECE student with a passion for Java Full Stack development, DSA, and problem-solving.  
I enjoy coding, building projects, and maintaining an organized GitHub portfolio.

## DSA Topics
All solutions are organized by topic folders. Each folder contains problems solved in **Java**, with proper explanations and approach.

 - **Arrays** ✅ (Completed)
- **Strings** ⬜ (Coming soon)
- **Linked Lists** ⬜ (Coming soon)
- **Trees** ⬜ (Coming soon)
- **Graphs** ⬜ (Coming soon)

> Each folder contains one file per problem. Time and space complexity are included in the code comments.

## Projects
- **IoT Smart Vehicle**: An automation system with sensors and Java backend.  
- **Other Projects**: Web apps, SQL projects, and additional coding projects.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/myakala-sandeep/DSA-Portfolio.git
Navigate to the topic folder you want to explore.

Open the Java file in your preferred IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.)

Run or study the code.

Alludu, just:  
1. Open your `DSA` folder in VS Code  
2. Create a new file → name it `README.md`  
3. Paste the above content  
4. Save, then add, commit, and push it to GitHub  

After that, your repo will **look complete and professional**.  

Do you want me to **also make it clickable so each folder links directly from README**?
